        <h3> Week one at Akirachix</h3>
        The warm welcome given to us by the alumni was the best part ,it felt like I was not new, rather a family member.<br>
        Given another chance I will still reapply to Akirachix .<br>
        An detailed orientation was done to our parents and us to help us understand school's policies and procedures, meet with advisors, and get acclimated to the campus.<br>

                After laying down a few casual activities I'd love nothing more than to express my learning journey which has been beyond mind blowing. 
                <ol>
                    <li>The class sessions has been interactive.</li>
                    <li>Both trainers and technical assistance are supportive and willing  to help.</li>
                    <li>The pratical assigments given to us are good helping us understanding the concepts being taught.</li>

                </ol>
                Although  I have had amazing experiences most of the time some of my negative experiences are:
                <ul>
                    <li>Cold showers through the nights and some mornings.</li>
                    <li>Lack of co-curriculum activities to help us take a break from the studies .</li>
                </ul>
                Having said that, the reputation of this organization precedes the characters hence the magnificent rankings.
